## Enhance documentation and implement equality members across various classes

- Improved XML documentation comments for multiple classes and members to provide clearer explanations of their purpose and usage.
- Implemented Equals and GetHashCode methods in every class to ensure proper equality comparisons and hash code generation.
- Enhanced ToString methods in several classes for improved string representation.
- Added event argument classes (e.g., TpCoordinatesReceivedEventArgs, MessageReceivedEventArgs) with appropriate documentation and equality members.
